# 👋 Hi, I'm Ritdhwaj Singh Chandel

**SDET Manager | SDET Architect | Automation Expert | DevOps Enthusiast | AI Enthusiast**

🌟 Welcome to my GitHub! With over 12 years of experience in full-stack test automation, I specialize in building scalable, robust frameworks across web, mobile, API, and desktop applications. I am passionate about driving quality engineering excellence, leading high-performing QA teams, and designing efficient automation strategies.  

Recently, I have been exploring Generative AI solutions to empower QA teams — building utilities that generate manual test cases directly from PRDs, as well as tools to assist in creating automation scripts more efficiently.
